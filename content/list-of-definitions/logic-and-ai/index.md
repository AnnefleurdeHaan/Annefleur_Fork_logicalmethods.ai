| Concept                                | Definition |
|----------------------------------------|------------|
| AI                                     | In general, AI is the field focused on creating machines or systems that exhibit behaviors deemed intelligent by human standards. In this course, AI is the study of the models and replication of _intelligent behavior_. |
| Classical logic                        | A traditional formal system based on bivalent truth values (the assumption that every sentence is either true or false) and principles like the law of the excluded middle. |
| Conclusion                             | A proposition that follows logically from premises within an argument. The conclusion of an inference is what's being inferred or established. |
| Formal derivations                     | Model of stepwise valid inference based on logical rules. Formal derivations are step-by-step applications of inference rules within a formal system to derive conclusions from premises. |
| Formal language                        | A set of strings constructed from an alphabet according to specific syntactic rules. |
| Formal models                          | Interpretations that assign meaning to the symbols and formulas of a formal language, used to evaluate truth. |
| (First) incompleteness theorem         | Gödel’s result showing that any sufficiently expressive, consistent formal system cannot prove all true statements expressible within its own language. Every logical system that is free of internal contradictions and models basic mathematical reasoning, has a mathematical statement in it that is undecidable in the system.|
| If-then rules                          | Symbolic representations of conditional statements used in rule-based systems: if condition A, then consequence B. The words _if_ and _then_ connect the antecedent to the consequent.|
| Indicators                             | Logical cues that signal the role of statements, i.e., the premises or the inference. |
| Inference                              | The process of deriving logical consequences from premises via valid rules. |
| Intuitionistic Logic                   | Assumes that truth needs to be constructed. A form of logic rejecting the law of the excluded middle, emphasizing constructivist proof over truth-as-correspondence. |
| Logical formulas                       | Well-formed expressions in a formal language, typically constructed from variables, connectives, and quantifiers. |
| Logical laws                           | General principles governing valid inference and logical equivalences. |
| Logic                                  | The systematic study of the principles of valid inference and correct reasoning. |
| Machine learning                       | A subfield of AI where systems learn patterns from data rather than being explicitly programmed with symbolic rules. |
| Metalogic                              | The study of properties of logical systems themselves, such as completeness, soundness, and decidability. |
| Premise                                | A statement assumed to be true within an argument from which a conclusion is derived. The conclusion is based on the premises of the inferences.|
| Proof theory                           | A model of stepwise valid inference. The study of formal proofs as mathematical objects, often used to analyze the structure and derivability in logical systems. |
| Semantics                              | A model of the meaning of the premises and conclusions. The branch of logic dealing with meaning and truth in formal languages, often via interpretations or models. |
| Subsymbolic AI                         | AI approaches that operate on distributed representations rather than explicit symbols. Subsymbolic AI prefers conditional probabilities and inductive inference over if-then rules and deductive inference.|
| Symbolic AI                            | The rules and inference mechanism of an expert system are completely transparent, human-readable and symbolic. |
| Syntax                                 | The formal rules governing the structure and formation of expressions in a formal language. |
| System 1 thinking                      | Fast, automatic, intuitive mental processes, often modeled in AI via heuristics or neural networks. |
| System 2 thinking                      | Slow, deliberative, analytical reasoning, often modeled via rule-based or symbolic systems. |
| Undecidability theorem                 | A theorem demonstrating that certain problems cannot be resolved algorithmically within a given formal system. |
| Validity                               | A property of arguments such that if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true. |
