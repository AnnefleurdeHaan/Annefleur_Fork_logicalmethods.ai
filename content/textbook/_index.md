Dear reader,

Welcome to _Logical methods for AI_, a new kind of logic textbook, specifically
geared at AI undergrads.

This is _not_ your standard logic textbook for AI, which covers the mathematics of
syntax, semantics, and proof theory, perhaps with an eye towards applying them
in AI.

It is also _not_ a general introduction to AI, not even an introduction to
logic-based AI. While we often discuss ideas and topics from AI
research and development, we don't provide an extensive, textbook level
discussion of them.

What this book _is_ is a first introduction to logical concepts, methods, and
results that teaches logic _via_ AI applications. That is, we introduce the
ideas of syntax, semantics, and proof theory by looking at how they are used in
AI research and development.

The course is intended to be taught as a first-year course of an undergrad AI
program.

While the book is self-contained, it is meant to be used by autonomous
individuals:

+ If you don't know something, look it up! 
+ If you don't understand something, ask!

Your education is in your own hands! Your teachers are here to help!

This is a university level course, which assumes that you're here on your own
volition, and that you're able and motivated to study. There's no
one-size-fits-all formula for how to learn, do it your own way! If you need
help, just ask.

This being a university level course also means that we often cover research
level topics. Even though this is a first-year course, at Uni, we're beyond
rehearsing established knowledge---you know how to do that now. The aim is to
push the boundaries of what's known, to form new thoughts and ideas, to change
the world.

And remember: "[At university], the teacher does not exist for the sake of the
student; both teacher and student have their justification in the common pursuit
of knowledge." -Wilhem von Humboldt

That said, I hope you enjoy this course!
