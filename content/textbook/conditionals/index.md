# Conditionals

In our discussion of {{< chapter_ref chapter="boolean" >}}
boolean algebra{{< /chapter_ref >}} so far, we've avoided dealing with
**conditionals**: "_if_ ..., _then_ ..."-statements which we formalize as $$A\to
B.$$ In this chapter, you'll learn about how conditionals are defined and used
in propositional logic. 

First, you'll learn about the truth-functional way of thinking about if-then
statements, the so-called 

+ [material conditional](#material-conditional). 

Then, we move on to inference patterns that are important for AI applications,
in particular:

+ [forward chaining](#forward-chaining),
+ [backward chaining](#backward-chaining).

We conclude with an outlook and remarks on [non-material
conditionals](#non-material-conditionals).

## Material conditional

How should we treat $A\to B$ in Boolean algebra? 

## Forward chaining

## Backward chaining

## Non-material conditionals

**Notes:**

[^tertium]: Historically, this assumption is known as _tertium non datur_, which
is Latin for "a third (truth-value) is not given".
