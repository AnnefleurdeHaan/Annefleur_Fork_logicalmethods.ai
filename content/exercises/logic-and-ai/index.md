# Definitions

## a.) Inference 

Give a definition of inference in the logical sense. Include some examples
of inferences, as well as non-examples, explaining why the definition applies
to the examples.

## b.) Validity {.homework}

Give a definition of deductive and inductive validity. For both, include some
examples of valid and invalid inferences, again explaining why the
definition applies.

_Hint_: A definition needs to fully explain the meaning of a concept. This is
typically done by saying under which precise conditions the concept applies.
That is, the answer should have the form like "A valid inference is an
inference such that..." or
"An inference is valid just in case ...".

# Indicators {.self-study .solved}

Give at least 5 additional examples of:

## a.)  

premise indicators,

## b.) 

inference indicators.

## Solution {#indicatorsSolution .solution}

a.) since, because, since, for, whereas, as 

b.) it follows that, thus, hence, consequently, we know that

# Validity { .solved }

Which of the following inferences is valid?

## a.) 

Every AI is logic-based. This an AI. So, this is a logic-based
system.

## b.) 

Well, I didn’t not cause the bug. So, I caused the bug.

## c.) 

C'mon, if _you_ build an AGI (artificial general intelligence), pigs can fly. So,
you didn't build an AGI.

## d.)

Every successful AGI is logic-based. So there _is_ at least one  successful AGI.

## Solution {#validitySolution .solution}

# Thinking fast and slow

Give at least 3 new examples of:

## a.)

system-1 thinking,

## b.)

system-2 thinking.

# Research { .research }

_Note_: These questions _require_ you to research the answer yourself using
reliable academic sources. You need to reference your sources!

## Decidability 

Are _all_ logical systems undecidable?

## Symbolic AI { .homework }

Give 2 examples of existing expert systems, one that "failed" and one that's
still in use today. Explain why the first one failed.

# Discussion {.discussion}

_Note_: These questions require a (short) _argumentative discussion_ as an
answer. That is you must provide _reasons_ in support for your answer and show
why they do support your answer.

## a.) Logic and system 2

Is all logical thinking system 2 thinking?

## b.) Minds and machines { .homework }

Does Gödel's theorem show that we cannot build a logic-based AGI?
